        Specialization Status (as of 2024):
        
        ✅ RFC 1210 approved (2015)
        ✅ Basic implementation in nightly Rust
        ⚠️  Soundness issues being resolved
        ⚠️  Some edge cases with lifetimes and coherence
        ❌ No stable timeline for release
        
        Key Issues:
        • Interaction with coherence rules
        • Lifetime specialization soundness
        • Backwards compatibility concerns
        • Complex implementation in rustc
        
        Alternatives Being Explored:
        • Min-specialization (subset of full specialization)
        • Const generics improvements
        • Associated type defaults

        Current Workaround Strategies:
        
        1. Explicit optimization functions (our current approach)
        2. Macro-based code generation
        3. Const generic tricks (limited)
        4. Type-level programming (complex)
        5. Wait for specialization (uncertain timeline)
        
        Our Choice: Explicit optimization + builder pattern
        • Clear performance characteristics
        • No unstable features required
        • User has control over optimization
        • Future-compatible with specialization
