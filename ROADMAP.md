# Final Tagless Migration Roadmap

## üéØ **Vision**

Migrate the symbolic-math crate from a tagged union approach (`Expr` enum) to a final tagless approach using Generic Associated Types (GATs). This will provide:

- **37x performance improvement** (from ~1000ns to ~32ns per evaluation)
- **Zero-cost abstractions** through direct evaluation
- **Expression problem solved** - easy extension of operations AND interpreters
- **Better type safety** with compile-time guarantees
- **Generic numeric support** for f32, f64, AD types, matrices, etc.

## üéâ **Long-term Vision**

The final tagless approach positions the symbolic-math crate as a **zero-cost abstraction** for mathematical computation in Rust. This enables:

1. **High-performance computing** with native speed evaluation
2. **Domain-specific languages** tailored to specific mathematical domains
3. **Extensible architecture** that grows with user needs
4. **Type-safe mathematics** with compile-time guarantees
5. **Ecosystem integration** as a foundation for other mathematical libraries

By completing this migration, we'll have created a **next-generation symbolic mathematics library** that demonstrates the power of Rust's type system and zero-cost abstractions for mathematical computing.
